WednesdayClub is our decentralized Wednesday based social network chat app! That means that we are storing information on the blockchain and media on IPFS (via Infura). WednesdayClub is unique in that it is only usable on Wednesdays and runs on WednesdayCoin!

## Decentralized
All the post, comment, and user data is stored on the blockchain (this contract)! When uploading any Media (pics, vids, sounds) the media gets stored in IPFS (via Infura). This helps us reduce what is being stored on the blockchain since storing large files is discouraged. Since it is all public anyone can create their own client to interact with the posts.
